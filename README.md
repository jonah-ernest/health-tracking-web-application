# Vida Fit — Health Tracking Web Application

This repository contains a full-stack web application developed for an undergraduate Information Systems course at the University of Toronto (Winter 2022).

The project focuses on designing and implementing a browser-based health tracking platform that allows users to log meals, sleep, exercise, and wellness goals, supported by a Java back end, SQL database, and a JavaScript front end.

This was a team course project, and the report and code reflect collaborative development.

## Project Overview

Vida Fit is a web-based personal health management system intended for university students. Users can:

- Create and manage personal profiles  
- Log meals, workouts, and sleep sessions  
- Track progress toward wellness goals  
- Search historical records  
- Access curated health resources  

The system was developed using a Waterfall V-Model methodology and follows a Model–View–Controller (MVC) architecture.

The final submission included working client and server implementations, UML diagrams, database schema, testing plans, and a comprehensive written report.
