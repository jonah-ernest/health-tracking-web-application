# Vida Fit — Health Tracking Web Application

This repository contains a full-stack web application developed as part of an undergraduate Information Systems course at the University of Toronto (Winter 2022).

The project focuses on designing and implementing a browser-based health tracking platform that allows users to log meals, sleep, exercise, and wellness goals, supported by a Java back end, SQL database, and a JavaScript front end.

This was a team project, and the full report and codebase reflect collaborative development.

- Create and edit personal profiles  
- Log meals, workouts, and sleep sessions  
- Track progress toward wellness goals  
- Search historical entries  
- View curated health resources  

The system was designed using a Waterfall V-Model methodology and follows an MVC (Model–View–Controller) architecture.

The final deliverable includes a fully implemented front end, REST-style back end services, database schema, UML diagrams, and a comprehensive design report.
